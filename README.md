# HYPERPARAMETER TUNING IN MACHINE LEARNING

## Overview

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the optimal values for a machine learning modelâ€™s hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are settings that control the learning process of the model, such as the learning rate, the number of neurons in a neural network, or the kernel size in a support vector machine. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the values that lead to the best performance on a given task.

## What are hyperparameters

In the context of machine learning, hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the training process of a model begins

## Hyperparameter tuning techniques

Models can have many hyperparameters and finding the best combination of parameters can be treated as a search problem. The two best strategies for Hyperparameter tuning are:

**GridSearchCV**

**RandomizedSearchCV**

**Bayesian Optimization**
